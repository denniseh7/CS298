initial recommended management of #migraine is with simple analgesics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol for the #headache.
i've got the worst migraines i've had in months &amp; no excedrin &amp; its really busy &amp; this girl makes me so unbelievably uncomfortable
@nytimesarts sounds just like today's right wing. meth, oxycodone, and @realdonaldtrump
fuck xanax
25mg of clonazepam and a coffee cake and peanut butter m&amp;ms 😡.
i mean, we could link embezzlement and fentanyl but maybe that's politics too far for even the queen's paradise
i will say ibuprofen is not nearly as addictive as benadryl. there's a reason i wasn't allowed to bring it from home.
prost turned in on senna there as clear as day. senna couldn't play the politics like prost though. #senna
senna what a brilliant film #legend #ayrtonsenna #f1
@roche_casey @mmpadellan i know that feeling. happened when i agreed with glenn beck during the campaign. i had to take a valium.

xanax makes music intense
hate the end of senna film. the race he died at imola was first race i watched when i was 5 y/o. still upsets me now watching it
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin or ibuprofen also help for #plantarfasciitis #heelpain.

@creneha you are very dramatic. prozac remember lol
the on-board footage is just amazing 😮 #senna
@blazersbysagar how much ibuprofen do you take???
@blazersbysagar benadryl is an antihistamine... and yes that'll make you drowsy or foggy
you now have to take children's tylenol, its good for for the ticker...its a known fact. #shitkevinsays
@spoiledashley_ sounds like you need adderall
i'm a functioning drug addict, drugs of choice? love, ecstasy, shrooms/acid, weed, xanax. in that order.
@christinadunnn (except whatever the hell benadryl is)
@fenchurchly @lunaticaardvark i second that. mucinex has saved me several times, but you'll need to push liquids. try a humidifier too.
sometimes not being insulin certified @ my job completely saves my ass 😭🤗🙌🏾

@nealroff up your nicotine. you'll feel better.
#senna documentary movie shows @prost_official to have been nasty &amp; unsporting, it also shows the fia to have been bent back then too #f1
@call_me_jamaica but i already got benadryl in my system from earlier. 😭 imma be out.

citalopram is also a wonderful drug. you literally die in your mind. nothing is there but space and time.
watching senna ....what a great driver he was ...not only did he have to fight against that smarmy frog frost but also the fia
@jayxiii oh yes. prost, senna, piquet, mansell and lauda. you can't get better than that. the cars were all shapes and sizes as well.

*switches to itv to watch senna* "if you no longer go for gap..." *switches off*
ibuprofen is what i need rn helpppp
i'm loving my botox results. not vain, just don't look angry anymore. lol.
dude - valium is a synthetic valerian? i've never tried the former pharm but i use the latter all the time.
#senna the man gave huge amount of money to charity. only made public after his death. class act to not brag about it when alive.
second tramadol just gone in, lads.

@a_looseend fuck that,senna is on... shows his arse smashing through his brain at the end...
the dentist was better off not giving me these promethazine pills.
if you ever leave me babe, leave some morphine out the door cause it will take a lot of medication to realize...
i need xanax, sleeping pills, alcohol &amp; weed. i need a lot of shit to help myself feel good
“will you still love me even when i have wrinkles on my face?” “botox helps…” hahahahahahahahaha
@shaylyncoslow she hasn't gotten out of bed once i don't think 🙄 her dad had to take her tylenol and a water in bed
@breakthehuddle indica, on the other hand, is more of a body/sleepy high, "relaxing" in the way, for instance, a xanax might be
#senna is on @wearestv i've got the box of tissues ready 😢
my sister just said a xanax is basically a chill pill 😅
watching senna shows how laughable it is when people compare hamilton v rosberg to senna v prost
formula one is a joke nowadays it's turning into a non contact sport like senna said racing is racing #formula1
senna 'the movie' on itv though, so at least i can cry myself to sleep watching my hero....for about the 30th time.
i swear to god jose is on the phone with some scamming viagra company and he's just playing along and fucking with them i'm gonna kill him
@mellesbellesmcr my back is killing, city have let me down. just necked 2 tramadol, washed down with rose. night mel. x
adderall is a meal in it of itself

my coworker is a viagra plug
@breakthehuddle (having done both, a xanax is a little more uhh powerful and doesn't really make you feel nice in the body in the same way)

@drantbradley @blackrepublican so again your failure is yet someone else's fault. melatonin is not the problem.
@lexiiii_coffey xanax is for that reason alone
@acneskinsite sugar increases blood sugar, which spikes insulin, which spikes sebum production levels😳
hmu for adderall and vape juice
i think the lexapro is starting to have a reverse effect im always angry i get annoyed easily and i cant go a day without wanting to die

all y'all aunties take metformin and lisinopril
i wonder does lewis hamilton watch senna the movie and be jealous of how it feels to be popular #senna
can't wait for senna to die in this filum.
@drugg1st the issue is that bupropion is a strong cyp2d6 inhibitor and the other drugs may mess with serotonin not just tramadol.

#f1 was so much better in the 80's &amp; 90's instead of the bores fest we have now #senna
@dranneellis @carrie_langley because "they've already used their epipen". never dropped the phone and ran so quickly.
ayrton senna what a legend he was
senna film if you've not seen it itv now
time for a percocet ...
when i cry, promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate exit my tear ducts at a stable concentration of 6.25mg/10mg per 5 ml
watching #senna always a sad watch, watching the enthusiastic driver talk about his future and the rest of his life and then it gets taken
we are now seeing younger women choosing to do #preventative treatments with #botox and fillers to fight wrinkles later on!
nicotine patches kill your arm. ffs.
home manicure = $.05 worth of vitamin e oil and $.05 worth of shea butter and a nail clipper. and polish. #makedoandmend
@ldubthewood take some benadryl. it will help with swelling/itchy.
watching #senna and considering the greatest #f1 drivers ever… i think i'd have to go 1. senna 2. schumacher 3. lauda 4. hamilton
lamoloxeline (ovulation inducer) used with advil to treat obsessive airscrew disorder obsoleted by prozac
@platte_michael i really wanna, but even 3000mg of tylenol won't help and today's going to be busy out the ass
somewhere between drink a red bull and eat a melatonin
@melaniejoya me: laughs out loud at this, looks at puppy with sad allergy eyes, decides to get her stoned on benadryl again and bake bread.
i'm very sad that my sister is really pretty, but she's had a lot of botox...i'd be pretty too, right?
the banana cupcake i just had worked better than the valium i took two hours ago lol

xanax on deck yeah
@sassypharmd i found a case report of nms with bupropion. she wanted to know if ss was possible so i told her it was but couldn't r/o nms
@_whsky go cold turkey....nicotine is out of your system after 2-3 days....if u really want to stop i found this the easiest tbh
@ldubthewood benadryl is good for sleep too. that's all that is in like tylenol pm is tylenol &amp; benadryl. :)

@sehunsanti drink water and take an ibuprofen.
@dory amoxicillin is still a thing i'm confused
@mallory1712 how about ambien and a walgreens brand suppository!
nicotine lozenges, gum, and patches use the same nicotine as #ecigs, therefore they are also "tobacco products"
death by valium and camembert

@thebodyshopuk the vitamin e cream smells like johnson baby lotion
watching senna movie
@turnleft2016 i bet viagra is still on the tga...
@evergloww_ have you tried prozac
downside to melatonin is being tired makes me all sneezy and i'm trying not to wake my parents :0
aryton senna would have succeeded in anything he chose to do in life u know. tht was a rare being.

taking your metformin inconsistently aka ultimate hell stomach
i feel so much better now that i'm off seroquel. no more feeling dazed or foggy.

@jennyp004 yeah so how do i get rid of the headache, i'm allergic to nsaids and it says not to take more like tylenol
@agite_reveur its just another way to scrape away at economic justice for women. for example viagra is tax exempt but tampons are not.
and a hint of fish oil
i will turn into a wild boar unless i get some lady nicotine very soon
@charlescwcooke he seems like someone who might take ambien. a lot of angst.
chick i live with ran out of beer while playing waterfall so she threw a bunch of ambien on the table
#opioids like #oxycontin increase the risk of a #heartattack &amp; #death dramatically but we keep marijuana illegal?/ #charleston #richmond #us

i've been on a hydrocodone/acetaminophen combo from getting my tooth out, and i keep falling asleep upright in the armchair.
@jennyp004 i'm taking percocet, but it says not to take more like tylenol with it.

sniffin vicodin in paris never felt so euphoric
no idea how reubens walked away from that. horrible accident! #senna #f1
@neilmj1984 @doctorchristian @jaketapper no, pizza (i disgree btw, pizza is fine) is a tobacco product cos tomatoes contain nicotine.
ummm idk if it's bad to take excedrin with soda but if it is at least i won't have anymore period cramps
@andrew1200 that's cause there's 325 mg of tylenol already in percocet but you'd be fine taking just straight tylenol just not all the time!
thank you @viagra you really helped me
@drcockymd can they still take metformin? i feel like i just did a ? where you had to order serum creatinine before starting a pt on metform
@allenwest bless you! mr west! need an allegra? maybe a viagra 😂😂
@pyrrhiclessons i'm sorry to go back to the insulin example, but it's the purest one i can think of. how is that *not* exploitation?
nothing says finals week like overhearing somebody sell adderall in the library bathroom
@simizu_raikou when you are up high, all the stuff that looks confusing &amp; messed up suddenly becomes crystal clear. -senna (bleach)
i popped a percocet . i'm tired
i'm not a fan of f1 but senna is a compelling, haunting piece of cinema. quite exceptional
i wonder how much money is being spent country wide on vyvanse/addy this week because of finals
soup, tea, airborne, rest an excedrin and i'm feeling 10x better.
from boxing to a legend in motors sport. i need a tissue already, this should not have happened 😢😢 — watching senna movie
@snuffster @beammeup_00 i need xanax.
senna the movie - imola 94 - unbelievable weekend - watching senna is haunting #senna race should never have happened
watching #senna - still gives me the chills #f1
@viagra thanks for the help! #problemsolved
just took a motrin 600, hope this helps me with my body aches and fever 😔
love the senna film, but it just makes no sense that they raced at imola that tragic day, after ratzenberger died the day before #f1
frank gave a baby vicodin what is this show
my back still hurts a little, i took 1000mg of ibuprofen and one sketchy looking muscle relaxer.

@elonmusk if saltwater desalination creates brine, is there a way of using this brine to create manmade salt mines to harvest lithium
@postsecret @nyt i wish we would do the same. my cousin used tylenol to help end her life 12 years ago
honestly, the exploitation of capitalism for adderall during finals week is beautiful. adam smith would be proud.
anyone else watching senna on itv right now and bawling their eyes out?
i'm watching the victoria's secret fashion show and there are quite a lot of viagra commercials. coincidence? i think not.
beyoncé - xo (junior senna &amp; m torrez tribal remix)

@propershameful i read this as psychedelic cold and pictured rainbow snot and benadryl fever dreams
how much melatonin is too much
my mom and dad came to denton today and my dad said "oh i have something for you" and slipped me an adderall omg
#3goodthings nearly a decade with @letum08, @mutedvirago a goal to work towards ritalin (i love this new hashtag)
it's hard watching this #senna documentary when you both know and remember seeing the awful ending happen 😞
so all i can take is a steroid &amp; some hydrocodone not the medicine that's actually important &amp; necessary for me to get over this mess lol
(strong texas accent) sonata ar'tica, gonna be a guhd metal laanup

@ashlarblocks has to be said i've not been back to gp for more temazepam since sleep clinic 18 months or so back. they can certainly help.
@schtaunkhauser @globebc mayor moonbeam said he would solve the homeless crisis, he never said how..#fentanyl
there were a lot of peanuts around at work today so i took benadryl and i've been sleepy for like 4 hours.
this zoloft is not making me not sad.
@dg1755 @adammoore09 awww... senna's on itv if he's preventing you getting up.
@kingnickrusso yep! my daughter says she listens to you every day on her wretched commute home. it's you or xanax. you're winning so far. 😎
@vernonlparker @makerswomen @billboard no, it looks more like botox or something..
@leavittalone @elempeng @dagnificent i had a seizure for the first time in like 6mos. because i haven’t been sleeping. not enough ambien.

it's like he knew he was gonna die that day. i so remember this. my late dad used to watch f1.... #senna
she was like "am i braiding too tight?" i'm like yea. she says "take some motrin" 😐
@leavittalone @elempeng @dagnificent and i haven’t hit the “i need moar ambien because fascism” point and never will because stubborn.
i'd quite like to overdose on xanax rn
i agree. monkey can't sell bananas. weather it's methadone or baby parts. money not morality or law will always dictate quantities. defund!!
i've had the pleasure of driving around imola… but it felt so poignant knowing what happened there, such a tragedy. #f1 #senna
#senna really don't want to watch this section of the documentary, but have to.
why is it that tv viewing audience are subjected to endless cialis commercials and not one for birth control? #freedom #freedomofchoice #cnn
popped 8 tablets of benadryl waiting for it to do its magic
@roiand my mom literally has to give my sister 5 billion xanax to knock out bro i don't sit near them when we go on flights lmao
adderall please 🚀🚀
must have watched #senna a dozen times and it never fails to shock me how much of a ballbag jean-marie balestre was. criminal in 1989
try not to be so salty that i graduated :-) take :-) another :-) xanax :-)
xanax is a no
@ripley180286 i know. born diabetic but have to work hard and buy insulin. i know it sucks but the reality is you have to work to partake.
@boaomega22 @nr1woman steroids...i have been taking prednisone for years now.
the f1 event should have been cancelled after the shocking death. #senna
also prost was a complete bore #senna
viagra is like corkin' the bat.
wow, the klonopin kicking in good tonight... sending this energy out for y'all to bask in as well
22 years after the event, i still find it incredibly difficult to watch the footage of #senna's accident. remember it so well. such a waste.
@erionnarose @zockery2010 update i've consumed half a bottle of ibuprofen today . it's fine i'm fine. we are def not in college anymore💀😂
@lee_duon because i didn't put you in that situation. if i injected you with insulin while asleep or tricked you into doing it, it is.
eat viagra charge
i've seen #senna a few times. i saw the race live. i'll never not feel immediately sick and in shock at the crash. it almost hurts to watch.
menthol and ozzy osbourne = 1 xanax
remember it so well, definitely one of those moments where you know where you were, what you were doing in life. #senna
ritalin? more like litalin!
hallelujah! holy shit! where's tylenol?
watching senna. legend.
cialis is my preferred stocking stuffer #signsivematured
@smileyo28 have you taken any prozac lately
in floods #senna
senna was a proper legend, i was sitting in my mum's car at cardwell garden centre in gourock when he crashed, never forget
i could use something stronger than a few excedrin right about now
"hallelujah! holy shit! where's the tylenol?"
@lotusoak gardasil vaccines harm and kill people. but you don't hear about it b/c there's too much $ involved. don't get gardasil vaccines.
senna is just a great piece of film
it's all fun and games until you a single mom of 3 with a crack problem and xanax charge. 😂😈😏
watching the film senna again on @itv - the footage during that 1994 san marino gp. the most haunting weekend in f1 history... #tears
it's like my brain is sitting at the popular lunch table in high school giving neurontin the cold shoulder because it's the new kid in town.
rest in peace to a sporting icon #senna #f1legend
watching the #senna film and yet again can't bare to watch the ending! so sad, the guy was a true racing legend
every time i see the end of senna it gets me. oh ayrton...
#senna always lived and always missed he brought so much joy to motorsport fans #rip always #f1
the guy on the other side of that fence also died. #senna
first time i've seen it since it happened. sad beyond belief. #senna
#russianhackers i just bought stock in prozac sales went through the roof in 2000 and i'm betting dems will be buying a lot of them now.
also i miss paul giamatti's dominance 2000-2005 and when he says he's on lexapro and xanax in sideways, geez. hi
@jonahnro oh my oh my. seroquel for mr. daou. hillary needed zero help for the distract and confuse the opponents part of the competition.

@chrisantenucci oxy and percocet are horrible, &amp; if a dr. thinks you are drug seeking, forget getting treated well.
aryton senna film got me welling up 🇧🇷 rip
probably the most heartbreaking thing watching senna go round that last chicane 😥 #senna #f1
playboi carti sound like rich boy on xanax
dr sid watkins commenting on #senna fatal head injury, "he sighed &amp; relaxed &amp; that was the moment his spirit had departed"☹️️☹️️
this adderall was such a good idea i literally finished all my study guides and made flash cards for two of my finals

senna is probably the best brazilian sportsperson of all time
@hyundai i miss my sonata 😭 she was my pretty red sleigh (with abs of course) forget key fobs as mistletoe how abt key fobs in stockings?🎄
told my husbands uncles to ask him why we don't have kids and they ended up offering him viagra! 😂😂😂
@kaseyboes my 2014 sonata had two items pop up for a recall. nothing out of the ordinary unless it's a complex time consuming repair.
the ending of senna gets me every time 😢😢😢
@globeandmail @globebc raising property taxes 2 stop fentanyl crisis or more money 2 feed all refugee's fleeing from a fake war! bull shit!!
senna and rush are amazing films , even if you hate formula 1, watch them
oh, man - the end of 'senna' (itv rn), gets me every time.
all i need is one final hit to soothe the pain while the valium takes effect.
even though you know the outcome, you can't help but feel uneasy and emotional every time you watch that corner at tambarello #senna
hi my name is gucci mane i'm addicted to everything bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
watching senna the movie still makes me emotional and i didn't even know him.
senna is such an amazing film/documentary but so so sad
today, i am thankful for ativan. 😭🙌🏼
shout out to aleve for helping me deal with this killer pain.. swelling went down, pain went down, and i was able to eat. #aleve

@bobbidylanxxx valtrex...true. still kinda scary though
@globeandmail @globebc i work front lines!! problem is not fentanyl overdoses, problem starts with "giving youth marijuana cards 4 weed!!"
i'm honestly going to buy stock in the makers of xanax. it looks like everything will be a huge blow up in the next 4 years.
watching senna the movie again. every time i watch that footage it takes me back to that weekend. a huge weekend in my childhood 😕
@southwestair hi! please help! i just spoke to savella 55. she ws so rude, and my original problem sill is not solved!

@dougstanhope when you "do" adderall, how much do you do? wanna see how you stack up with the middle schoolers.
@frank8427zz9za @w0tn0t @australian so if i become australian i can have multiple wives having benefits? free viagra prescriptions? tops👍
@beccalader no you're fine. advil is ibuprofen! how many mg are they?
@tony_calvin tragic brilliant sad - senna epic talent
got some adderall time to mix it up with some alcohol
just watched senna for the first time. one of the best sports movies i've ever seen.
@timedrop3 gonna take morphine or something to knock me out xd

i just want to announce that i officially hate zoloft. and yet, i'm sure i'm chemically dependent on it.
