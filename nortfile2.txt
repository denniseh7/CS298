@bobjherman they command market share, low possibility of new strong competition, patients don't switch insulin brand often,so they can
so basically if i die, it's probably because i od'd on benadryl.
i hope this benadryl kicks in quick
didn't think it would be this hard to find adderall in college 😒

i hate the cold, but i love nicotine.
okay tylenol with codeine. why won't you let me sleep, asshole?
also a gallon of ice cream, cheesy potatoes, a bottle of ibuprofen and/or muscle relaxers, and a heating pad would be great
so if you ever wanna know a way to kill me... just drug me up with 25 bottles of amoxicillin 😊😂
i wrote cristine a note while on hydrocodone &amp; the first sentence is 'you remind me of a hibiscus flower. idk if theyre pink but ur hair is'
